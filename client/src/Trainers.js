    <p>Hometown: NYC</p>
    <p>Quote: "’ve been lifting regularly for the past 3 years 
    after almost 15 years of competitive baseball. When I first stopped baseball, I struggled finding outlets to stay regularly active and fit—this led to a number of injuries during recreational sports, along with overall mental struggles. It wasn’t until I started lifting regularly that I realized just how significant frequent intense exercise was in improving my quality of life. After that, I decided to really start prioritizing my health and longevity."</p>
